## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/DzMVabtu/ace)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/AdaptivApps-b8ff290465be4c5d813425c774f6bd25)

[UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/xuXwvLz0LDnQC3rS53129B/Adaptivapps%2C-Josh-Armantrout?node-id=218%3A1)

A nonprofit organization and is looking for a better way to engage their staff, volunteers, athletes, parents, coaches and spectators. This app would need to be digitally accessible with the ability to meet various physical changes.

### Key Features

- User Onboarding
- Create Events / Register for Events
- Calendar / Map Features
- Real time Chat

## Tech Stack

#### [Front end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/AdaptivApps-fe)

### Front end built using:

#### _React_

Why did you choose this framework?

- Easy to learn and use
- Reusable components
- Fast rendering with virtual DOM
- Testability

#### Front end deployed to `AWS`

When deploying, in `App.js` change the `wsLink uri` to be `wss://apollo.adaptivdev.net/graphql` - if it isn't changed from the local endpoint websocket connection will fail and product Network / GraphQL authentication errors.

When testing locally, in `App.js` change the `wsLink uri` to be `ws://localhost:8000/graphql` - if it isn't changed from the porduction endpoint websocket connection will fail and produce Network / GraphQL authentication errors.

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/AdaptivApps-be) built using:

#### **Prismatopia(graphQL, Apollo, Prisma)**

- Generated Crud Schema
- GraphQl is fastest query slinger this side of the mississippi!
- Bernie Durfee is the man!

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=this is the client id found in our application that is being hosted on Auth0
    REACT_APP_API_URL=can be found in the AWS Amplify application. This is the authentication API
    REACT_APP_CLIENT_DOMAIN=auth0 domain for the AdaptivApps application
    REACT_APP_AUDIENCE=auth0 endpoint for the AdaptivApps application

# Testing

We used Jest beacuse it has everything we need to unit test our application

# Installation Instructions

Yarn install -> NOT npm install (several packages install dependencies and yarn installs all those project dependencies while npm will not)
npm run start

If a terminal error occurs around `babel-jest`, delete the following folders:

- node_modules
- package-lock.json
- yarn.lock

Remove `babel-jest` from package.json and run `yarn install`

## Other Scripts

    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "lint": "eslint"
